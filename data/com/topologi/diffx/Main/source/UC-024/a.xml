alkaloids, semisynthetic derivatives, quaternary ammonium compounds,
and, to a lesser extent, the synthetic tertiary amines inhibit the
muscarinic actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by
postganglionic cholinergic nerves as well as on smooth muscles that
respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These
postganglionic receptor sites are present in the autonomic effector
cells of the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, sinoatrial and atrioventricular
nodes, and exocrine glands. Depending on the dose, anticholinergics
may reduce the motility and secretory activity of the gastrointestinal
system, and the tone of the ureter and urinary bladder and may have
a slight relaxant action on the bile ducts and gallbladder. In general,
the smaller doses of anticholinergics inhibit salivary and bronchial secretions,
sweating, and accommodation; cause dilatation of the pupil; and increase
the heart rate. Larger doses are required to decrease motility of

<P fmcssattr = "2">Following use of the transdermal disk of hyoscine,
a dilated and fixed pupil has been reported on the side where the
disk was worn. This condition usually resolves spontaneously within
a few days, but may persist for up to 2 weeks after the disk has
been removed and thus may be mistaken for a sign of intracranial
neoplasm, subdural haematoma, or aneurysm. To avoid extensive neuroradiological
tests, instillation of 1% pilocarpine solution is recommended as
an aid in the diagnosis of non-neurogenic dilation of the pupil.<Citeref
