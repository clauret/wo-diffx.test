   <para>
      <drugname>DrugB</drugname> (drotxxxxgin alxa (activated) )
is a recombinant form of human Activated Protein E. An established
human cell line possessing the complementary DNA for the inactive human
Protein E zymogen secretes the protein into the fermentation medium.
Fermentation is carried out in a nutrient medium containing the
antibiotic geneticin sulfate. Geneticin sulfate is not detectable in
the final product. Human Protein E is enzymatically activated by
cleavage with thrombin and subsequently purified. <xref dest="">

   <para>Drotxxxxgin alxa (activated) is a serine protease with the same
amino acid sequence as human plasma-derived Activated Protein E.
Drotxxxxgin alxa (activated) is a glycoprotein of approximately 55
kilodalton molecular weight, consisting of a heavy chain and a light
chain linked by a disulfide bond. Drotxxxxgin alxa (activated) and
human plasma-derived Activated Protein E have the same sites of
glycosylation, although some differences in the glycosylation
structures exist.</para>



   <para>
      <drugname>DrugC</drugname> is supplied as a sterile, lyophilized, white to off-white powder for intravenous infusion. The 5 and 20 mg vials of <drugname>DrugB</drugname> contain 5.3 mg and 20.8 mg of drotxxxxgin alxa (activated) , respectively. The 5 and 20 mg vials of <drugname>DrugB</drugname>
also contain 40.3 and 158.1 mg of sodium chloride, 10.9 and 42.9 mg of
sodium citrate, and 31.8 and 124.9 mg of sucrose, respectively.</para>
