<P fmcssattr = "1">Aciclovir is converted to aciclovir monophosphate,
a nucleotide, by herpes simplex virus (HSV)–coded thymidine kinase.
Aciclovir monophosphate is converted to the diphosphate by cellular
guanylate kinase and to the triphosphate by a number of cellular
enzymes. Aciclovir triphosphate interferes with HSV DNA polymerase
and inhibits viral DNA replication. The triphosphate can be incorporated
into growing chains of DNA by viral DNA polymerase, resulting in
termination of the DNA chain. Since aciclovir is preferentially
taken up and selectively converted to the active triphosphate form
by HSV-infected cells, it is much less toxic to normal uninfected
cells.<Citeref Rid = "CXX01" Exclude-comma = "1"/><Citeref Rid = "CXX04"
